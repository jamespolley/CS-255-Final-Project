# CS-255-Final-Project

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project aims to help people learn how to drive. It consists of plans for a web-based system that provides online learning materials and the ability to schedule in-person lessons.
### What did you do particularly well?
I think the diagrams I made (e.g. the use case diagrams) are good in understanding various aspects of the system.
### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I could have made the PowerPoint better and included speaker notes.
### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpretted the user's needs literally. Because they are the ones who will use it...
### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Designing software involves creating structures that are logical and easy to reason about. This involves splititng the project into smaller pieces that are each responsible for something different. In the future, I will follow a similar strategy.
